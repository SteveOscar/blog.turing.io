Earlier this week  I wrote [some thoughts on software quality and the evolution of the industry](http://blog.turing.io/2015/06/02/selfconf-searls/) based on
 [Justin Searls' "Sometimes a Controller is Just a Controller"](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2015-05-11-sometimes-a-controller-is-just-a-controller.html) at [Self.Conference](http://selfconference.org/). Today, I'd like to continue with thoughts based off <a href='https://twitter.com/nylons'>Nancy Lyons</a>' "There's No Such Thing as Work/Life Balance" session. I found a [version of her deck as a PDF here](http://pls.printing.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Keynote-Nancy-Lyons-Tues.pdf). I took three pages of notes during the session, but one idea really stuck with me.

I thought a lot about what Nancy called "bringing your whole self to work." She explained that at [Clockwork](https://twitter.com/Clockwork_Tweet), they want the staff to feel fully integrated. If you're goofy, be goofy at work. That they can be professional, effective, and still be true to their character. "Happy people do good work," she says.

Thinking back over my own employment history, the times I felt most disconnected from my job were those where I had to play someone else. When the high school I taught at transitioned from an open dress code to one that necessitated tucked-in button downs and slacks it was *demoralizing*. There was a young teacher who cried because she wasn't sure how she'd afford new clothes. I felt ridiculous because a big part of my job was crap like climbing under tables to run network cables, and now I was doing it in an ironed shirt.

I don't think it's ridiculous for people to wear professional dress to work. There have been more than one time where I've looked around in a group of developers and thought *"C'mon y'all, we can do better."* But the problem with that imposition of a dress code was that it made it feel like I was playing a character. *This is what a teacher should look like.* Or, even, *this is what a REAL teacher should look like, unlike you.* I wasn't myself at work and that felt terrible.

At Turing we ask a lot of our students. Many of them relocate to Denver for our class. We ask them to give up their job, spend less time with the people they care about, defer their fun and hobbies, and work incredibly hard for seven months. Since Nancy's talk I've been asking myself "do we make space for people to bring their *whole self* to Turing?"

In that vein, we're going to try an experiment: "whole self Fridays." Our Friday schedule is already focused on community building. We spend time in staff/student 1-on-1s, cohort retros, whole-school culture development, guest speakers, and small-group/self study. I want to try recognizing some of the people who are important to us outside of Turing -- to show and share a bit more of our whole selves.

For the next four weeks we'll try an experiment. On Fridays, our students are invited to have the people who are important to them here. Have a significant other who works remotely? Invite them to do it here. Have a kid who is at daycare or off school for the summer? Bring them in. As long as you, the student, can still participate in the community-building work that we have to do on Fridays, then it'll work.

Or, it'll be total chaos and at least we can laugh at a mob of children overrunning the dungeon. And we can ask *"if Fridays are for our 'whole-self' are the other days for our 'partial-selves'? If so, is it like a different 20% of the self each day or, maybe, like start with 20% on Monday and accumulate towards 100% on Friday?"*

I'll write up observations and next steps in a few weeks.
